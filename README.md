# NC/RP News

Welcome to my first app! ðŸ‘‹

# Info

This is my first front-end app which was created during my time at Northcoders. To see it working [click here](https://rp-news.netlify.app).

Or, if you'd like to run this locally on your machine, clone this repo with https://github.com/richardparle/nc-news.git and run 'npm start' in the terminal. To ensure it works correctly, please ensure you have at least version 14.17.3 of Node.
